# RL Text-Based Game Agents

This repository contains implementations of **reinforcement learning agents** for a simple **text-based game environment** inspired by an interactive home setting. The project explores three learning algorithms to solve text-based quests:

- ✅ **Tabular Q-Learning**
- ✅ **Linear Function Approximation**
- ✅ **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**

The environment, called **Home World**, includes rooms like the kitchen, garden, bedroom, and living room. Each quest (e.g., *eat apple*, *take nap*) requires the agent to interpret text and navigate accordingly.
